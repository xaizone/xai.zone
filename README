===============================

A simple upload service written in PHP.

This service is currently deployed and is completely free to use on:
    https://xai.zone/

This service of mine was heavily inspired by https://0x0.st, but made with PHP instead! 
Make sure to check out the original project and send some love!

Also if you are able to selfhost this, please do... centralization is bad.
